[Verse 1]
          G        Em
I found a love for me
              C                            D
Darling, just dive right in, and follow my lead
                G          Em
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
        C                                     D
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

[Pre-Chorus]
                                G
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            Em                      C                G  D
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this ti-ime
             G                           Em
Darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
            C                     D
And in your eyes you're holding mine

[Chorus]
      Em   C             G          D              Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
          C                G                 D              Em
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
         C                G        D             G
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
                G                    Em
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
              C                                          D
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
           G             Em
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
         C                              D
To carry love, to carry children of our own

[Pre-Chorus]
                             G                     Em
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds
             C               G  D
I know we'll be alright this ti-ime
             G                              Em
Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
         C               D
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus]
      Em   C              G         D              Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        C                G                D
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
  Em       C                  G        D          [ G ]
I don't deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight

I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met an angel

In person, and she looks perfect
